## 🏗️ AWS Infrastructure Architecture

### Production-Ready AWS Stack
```
🌐 Route 53 (DNS) → Application Load Balancer (SSL)
   ↓ Routes traffic to
🚀 ECS Fargate Cluster (Auto-scaling containers)
   ↓ Connects to
🗄️ RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ, encrypted, automated backups)
   ↓ Uses for caching
⚡ ElastiCache Redis (High availability, encrypted)
   ↓ Stores files in
📁 S3 Bucket (Encrypted, versioned storage)
   ↓ Monitored by
📊 CloudWatch (Logs, metrics, alerts)
```

### Security Features
- **VPC with private subnets** for database isolation
- **Security groups** with least privilege access
- **IAM roles** with minimal required permissions
- **Secrets Manager** for secure credential storage
- **SSL/TLS encryption** for all traffic
- **Database encryption** at rest and in transit

## 🌊 DigitalOcean Architecture

### Simplified Managed Services
```
🌐 Custom Domain (Optional) → App Platform (Auto SSL)
   ↓ Runs containerized app
🚀 Managed Container Service (Auto-scaling)
   ↓ Connects to
🗄️ Managed PostgreSQL (Automated backups, monitoring)
   ↓ Uses for caching
⚡ Managed Redis (High availability)
   ↓ Monitored by
📊 Built-in Monitoring (Metrics, logs, alerts)
```
