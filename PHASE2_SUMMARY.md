  - `POST /api/scraping/product/:id` - Scrape single product
  - `POST /api/scraping/all` - Scrape all products
  - `GET /api/scraping/history/:productId` - Price history
  - `GET /api/scraping/last-scraped` - Last scraping info
  - `POST /api/scraping/schedule/start|stop` - Control scheduling

### 5. Frontend Integration
